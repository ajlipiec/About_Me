        <h2>About Andy</h2>

        <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Originally from Michigan, I've move around the country over the years, also living in Indiana, Wisconsin, Colorado, and now Oregon. In that time, I've had amble oppertunity to much money on higher education. I went to Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, IN and recieved a bachelors degree in <strong>exercise science</strong>. I then went back to school sometime later and achieved a doctorate in <strong>occupational therapy</strong>. I'm learning to program to explore potential career paths but also to to just learn a <em>new skill</em>. I like to spend most of my time hiking, rock climbing, and riding my bike around the city. Currently, I'm working as an <strong>office eronomics consulting</strong> for various individuals and companies in the area and am excited to expand my brand and company.

        <h2>Projects Completed and in Constant Progress</h2>
          <p>So far, I;ve compelted several projects, all coded using HTML, MD, and/or using a bootstrap framework. Many of the projects are "unpolished" becuase I have spent the majority of my time eperimenting and exploring with the different styles, techniques, and elements. Check out some of these projects completed at Epicodus on GitHub:
